# ticketing MicroServices

## Overview



This project is a microservices-based ticketing platform that facilitates the buying and selling of tickets for various events. The architecture is designed with scalability, resilience, and maintainability in mind. The technologies used include Docker, Kubernetes, Skaffold, Ingress, TypeScript, Node.js, and React.js/Next.js.



## Features



- **Microservices Architecture:** The project is built on a microservices architecture, allowing for modular development, deployment, and scaling of different components.



- **Docker:** Containerization is implemented using Docker, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.



- **Kubernetes:** Orchestrating the deployment and scaling of containers is managed by Kubernetes, providing a robust and scalable infrastructure.



- **Skaffold:** The development workflow is streamlined with Skaffold, which automates the building and deployment of applications in a Kubernetes cluster.



- **Ingress:** Ingress is used to manage external access to services, providing a unified entry point for handling external traffic.



- **TypeScript:** The backend services and frontend components are written in TypeScript, bringing static typing to the development process for enhanced code quality and maintainability.



- **Node.js:** The backend services are implemented using Node.js, ensuring a fast and scalable server-side runtime.



- **React.js/Next.js:** The frontend is built with React.js, and optionally Next.js for server-side rendering, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface.
